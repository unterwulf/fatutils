This package contains a pickle and utils for working with FAT filesystem
images using GNU poke.

Installation
============

In order to use these tools you will need GNU poke 1.2. You can just run them
from the source directory or you can use the following command under super
user to install them system-wide (tune PREFIX value, default is /usr/local):

  $ make PREFIX=/usr install

Known issues
============

All utils but fatinfo and fatcluster works painfully slow. They are in fact
useless for anything bigger than FAT12 due to performance issues. Contact me
if you know what is wrong with them.
